identify_prompt = """
You are an expert table reader from HTML.

You are given multiple HTML tables extracted from an invoice. Read every table and its corresponding HTML code carefully.

Identify the table containing line items (such as product/service, quantity, price, etc.).

Your task is to extract:
1. `main_table_index`: index of the main line item table
2. `items`: each row of item data from that table (e.g., product, quantity, rate, etc.)
3. `summary_row`: If the table has any footer/summary row data like total, tax, etc.

Return **ONLY JSON** inside triple backticks like this:
- Do NOT use markdown formatting or YAML
- Do NOT include any explanation, comments, or notes
- Your entire output must be a valid JSON object like:
```json
{{
  "main_table_index": 0,
  "items": [
    {{ "Sr. No.": "1", "Description": "Soap", "Rate": "50.00" }}
  ],
  "summary_row": {{
    "Total": "1000.00",
    "Tax": "180.00"
  }}
}}
```
